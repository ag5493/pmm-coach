# PMM Onboarding Coach — by MOR

A structured AI-powered practice environment for first-time Product Marketing Managers, built for Series B B2B SaaS reality.

---

## What It Does

This app gives new PMMs a safe space to practice, get feedback, and build confidence before and during their first 90 days — without needing an expensive coach.

### Modules

| Module | What It Does |
|---|---|
| 🎭 Stakeholder Roleplay | Practice difficult conversations with a skeptical founder, territorial PM, dismissive sales lead, or ambiguous executive. Get feedback after each session. |
| 📋 Work Reviewer | Paste any PMM artifact (positioning doc, competitive brief, battle card) and get structured, senior-PMM-level feedback. |
| 🗓️ 30-60-90 Plan Builder | Answer a few questions about your company and role, and get a tailored onboarding plan built for your specific situation. Download it as Markdown. |
| 🔥 Pressure Test | Explain your strategy out loud. A senior PMM will challenge your assumptions and poke holes — before the real meeting. |

cd pmm-coach
```

### 2. Install dependencies

You can either:

**Option A** — Enter it in the app sidebar (easiest, no setup needed)

## Deploying to Streamlit Cloud

1. Push this repo to GitHub
2. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
3. Connect your repo and set `app.py` as the entry point
4. Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` as a secret in the Streamlit Cloud dashboard (Settings → Secrets):

```toml
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "sk-ant-your-key-here"
```

> **Note:** If you add the key as a Streamlit secret, you can remove the sidebar key input from `app.py` and load it with `st.secrets["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"]` instead.
